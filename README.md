# Introduction 
`next-wayfinder` is a lightweight (_~3kb minzipped_) and flexible package that makes it easy to apply different Next.js 
middlewares based on the route, without having to use cumbersome and error-prone path checks. 
This allows you to easily manage and maintain your middlewares, and keep your app clean and organized.

## Installation
```sh
  npm install next-wayfinder
```

## Why 
This package was created based on [this discussion][discussion-link]. 
In the discussion, a user highlighted the difficulty to handle complex routing inside the 
Next.js middleware. For instance having a `withAuth` middleware only for paths matching `/dashboard/:path*` and an i18n middleware on a subdomain.
As of now, this can be archived via ugly path checking inside a middleware matching almost all the routes.
With `next-wayfinder` I aim to add some ease until Next will support officially multiple middleware for different matchers.


## Quick Start
`next-wayfinder` exports an `handlePaths` function that can be used as middleware entry point. 
It accepts an array of [`Middleware`](./src/types.ts) matching the route or the domain.

```ts
// middleware.ts

import { handlePaths } from 'next-wayfinder'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// the first matching middleware will be applied
export default handlePaths([
  {
    matcher: '/dashboard/:path*',
    // additional filter 
    guard: params => params.lang === 'en',
    handler: async req => {
      // url params are injected by `handlePaths`
      // in addition to req.query
      // this is done because you might want to handle paths 
      // that are not available under your `app` or `pages` directory.
      console.log(req.params) 
      

      // do some checks
      if ( !isAuthenticated(req) ) {
        return NextResponse.redirect('/')
      }

      // continue the request
      return NextResponse.next()
    }
  }, {
    domain: /^app\./,
    // rewrites all routes on domain app.* to the `pages/app/<path>`
    handler: req => NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/app${req.nextUrl.pathname}', req.url))
  }
])
```

### What if I want to check paths on subdomain?
In some cases you might want to check paths on a subdomain (ie using the same project for handling both public website and the dashboard).
This can be easily archived by passing as handler an array of middleware. This `handlePaths` iterates recursively all the items provided (even the nested ones)
so a very high level of complexity can be "handled". Anyway to improve performance I'd recommend to keep it as simple as possible.

```ts
// middleware.ts

export default handlePaths([{
  domain: /^app\./,
  handler: [
    {
      matcher: '/',
      handler: req => NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.url))
    },
    {
      matcher: '/:path*',
      handler: () => NextResponse.next(),
    }
  ]
}])
```
